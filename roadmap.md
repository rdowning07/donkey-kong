# 🎮 Asteroids Curriculum Roadmap

**Goal:** First-principles game development mastery through progressive building.
**Language:** Python + Pygame → C++ (later)
**Format:** 30 min/day. Write code yourself. Claude checks work and teaches concepts.

## The Ladder

```
Pong → Asteroids → Donkey Kong → Super Mario Bros → Castlevania → Symphony of the Night → Diablo I → Warcraft I → Diablo II/WoW
```

---

## ✅ LEVEL 1: Pong — Complete

Core game loop, state, collision detection, scoring, paddle and ball physics.
Repo: https://github.com/rdowning07/pong

- [x] Game loop
- [x] Variables and state
- [x] Keyboard input
- [x] Moving objects
- [x] Collision detection
- [x] Scoring
- [x] Game over and restart

---

## ✅ LEVEL 2: Asteroids — Complete

### What You're Really Learning

Motion that isn't just left/right/up/down. Objects rotate. Things spawn and despawn. Lists of objects instead of one or two.

### Skills Checklist

- [x] Repo setup with pyenv
- [x] Game loop with delta time
- [x] Ship class with rotation
- [x] Thrust and momentum
- [x] Screen wrap
- [x] Asteroid class with movement
- [x] Multiple asteroids in a list
- [x] Bullet class
- [x] Shooting mechanic
- [x] Collision detection (circle vs circle)
- [x] Asteroid splitting
- [x] Game over state
- [x] Score tracking

### Architecture Concepts

- [x] What is delta time and why does it matter?
- [x] What is a vector?
- [x] What is a class and what is an instance?
- [x] What does it mean to update a list of objects every frame?
- [x] What is momentum in code?

### Deliverable

Playable Asteroids. Ship rotates and thrusts, shoots bullets, asteroids split on hit, game ends when ship is hit, score tracked.

**2. Understand before moving on.**
**3. Boring, explicit code first.**
**4. Git every session.**
**5. The README is part of the work.**
